# @chatkitty/core

## Installation

### Install with NPM

npm install @chatkitty/core
```

### Install with Yarn

```bash
yarn add @chatkitty/core
```

## How to use

### Getting an API key

You'll need [a ChatKitty account](https://dashboard.chatkitty.com/authorization/register) before you can
begin building chat with ChatKitty. After creating your account, create a ChatKitty application using the dashboard
and copy its API key from your application's setting page.

### Initialize the SDK with your API key

With your API key you can initialize a new instance of the [ChatKitty JS client](https://chatkitty.com/docs/chatkitty-js-core/classes/ChatKitty):

```js
const chatkitty = ChatKitty.getInstance(CHATKITTY_API_KEY);
```

### Starting a user session

To make calls to ChatKitty as a user, a user session must be started.

You can start a user session using the unique username of a user and optional authentication
parameters to secure the user session.

```js
await chatkitty.startSession({
  username: email,
});
```

### Starting a chat session

Before a user can begin sending and receiving real-time messages and use in-app chat features like
typing indicators, delivery and read receipts, emoji and like reactions, etc, you'll need to start a chat session.

```js
chatkitty.startChatSession({
  channel: channel,
  onMessageReceived: (message) => {
    // handle received messages
  },
  onKeystrokesReceived: (keystrokes) => {
    // handle received typing keystrokes
  },
  onTypingStarted: (user) => {
    // handle user starts typing
  },
  onTypingStopped: (user) => {
    // handle user stops typing
  },
  onParticipantEnteredChat: (user) => {
    // handle user who just entered the chat
  },
  onParticipantLeftChat: (user) => {
    // handle user who just left the chat
  },
  onParticipantPresenceChanged: (user) => {
    // handle user who became online, offline, do not distrub, invisible
  },
});
```

All handler methods are optional, so you only needed to register handlers for chat events your application cares about.
